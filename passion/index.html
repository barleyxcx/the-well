            my favorite moment of the night is
            when it's all light sound and blurry vision enrapturing
            when the cold air hits me as I step out the uber
            when time thins into a filament I swallow
            when the absence of living is not deadly
            when novelty is a fool's burden
            when i'm not afraid
            when I'm sweaty forgetting and gossamer possibility
            when he brushes past me and puts his hand on the small of my back
            when I remember I have a small of my back
            <!-- when it's not being touched it's remembering that I can be touched <br> -->
            when it's the sweet bliss of oblivion
            when it's not about knowing better it's about knowing nothing
            when I do it every weekend like a ritual
            when our gazes lock, a dance of power
            when you be/hold me and I be/hold you
            when I know who I am because you told me so
            when the club is a pilgrimage site
            when i'm locked in time with the bellow of a kick drum
            when I'm stuck in sound and vision something like religion
            when i'm with my friends
            when I'm the disco ball, the grid of mirrors made up of reflections
            when you and i become enmeshed
