            <p>I’ve been resisting grand proclamations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="phrase2">
            <p>I came across this <a href="https://twitter.com/lur_ag/status/1635864282507395073?s=20">TikTok</a> making fun of how “diaspora kids” write about their histories, cultures, and “motherland.” Using my diasporic identity to signal any sort of <a href="https://astra-mag.com/articles/blunt-force-ethnic-credibility/">ethnic credibility</a> or ownership is simplifying and stupid at best, silencing and solipsistic at worst.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="phrase3">
            <p>I’ve been resisting grand proclamations because singularity is a tool of control.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="phrase4">
            <p>In order to wield a sword, a smith casts steel into a single shape, hammering it down to become sharper and sharper into one single point. I want to refuse the temptation to become a blade for digestability or traditional art-world success.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="phrase5">
            <p>Somewhere along the line, I forgot that identities and borders are abstractions. Imagined things. What am I calling back to when I say words like “Trinidad and Tobago” and “India” and “Hindu?"</p>
        </div>
        <div class="phrase6">
            <p>Whose words are these? Have they not been blades too? Tempered by a Smith’s flame and a hammer to become one thing. Called upon to inflict horrific acts of violence? I don’t want to be a sword, I want to be the sheath.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="phrase7">
            <p>The holding thing. <a href="https://otherfutures.nl/uploads/documents/le-guin-the-carrier-bag-theory-of-fiction.pdf">The carrier bag.</a> The vessel that holds it all and lets them get all mixed up.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="phrase8">
            <p>In <em>The Argumentative Indian</em>, Amartya Sen suggests that heterodoxy is essential to India’s history and past. The ability to hold, yes, that’s what a country can be right? But I don’t wanna be a country I just wanna be an embrace. Without large hands grasping at even larger fixtures of identity what do I have? Who do I have? What’s left in the smallest parts of me that I can hold onto?</p>

        <div class="phrase9">
            <p>Can I be so lucky as to stumble upon a laugh,</p>
